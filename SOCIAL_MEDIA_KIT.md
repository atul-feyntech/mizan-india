## Launch Campaign

### Launch Tweet/Post #1 - Announcement
```
⚖️ Introducing MIZAN

Ab tolo, phir khao.

We rated 5,000+ Indian packaged foods based on what's ACTUALLY in them.

No marketing fluff. No paid rankings. Just FSSAI data + brutal honesty.

Your Maggi? 2 stars. Your "health drink"? Probably worse.

### Launch Tweet #2 - Problem Statement
```
🇮🇳 India's packaged food problem:

• 73% of Indians are protein deficient
• 57% of women have anemia
• 89 million have diabetes

And we're eating "healthy" snacks loaded with sodium and sugar.

Time to see the truth.

### Launch Tweet #3 - Product Example
```
Bournvita says: "Tayyari jeet ki" 💪

Mizan says:
- 37g sugar per 100g
- That's 7+ teaspoons per serving
- Same as eating chocolate

Our rating: ⭐⭐ (2/5)

### Launch Tweet #4 - How It Works
```
How Mizan rates your food:

1️⃣ We use FSSAI's own nutrition guidelines
2️⃣ Based on sodium, sugar, saturated fat per 100g
3️⃣ Compare against ICMR daily limits
4️⃣ Give you a clear 1-5 star rating

No opinions. Just math.
